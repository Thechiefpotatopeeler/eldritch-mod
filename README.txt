The eldritch mod is a minecraft spellcrafting mod, about making spells, adventuring, and doing other
cool stuff.

Even though it has a GNU LGPL, which says you can't contribute, that's just because I want to monitor
contributors, I'm not saying you can't make a remote fork and issuing a pull request.
