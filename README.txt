This is the eldritch mod!

Credit to me (Rhyw/thechiefpotatopeeler) and the other devs I personally invited to the project (obviously), 
the devs on github who made commits, Fith3r (the texture artist) for doing some of the textures,
 and anyone else who I may add to this list later.

The eldritch mod is a minecraft magic and exploration mod, inspired by ars magica 2 (some work needed), about making spells, adventuring, and doing other
cool stuff (hence the first clause).

Even though it has a GNU LGPL, which says you can't contribute, that's just because I want to monitor
contributors, I'm not saying you can't make a remote fork and issue a pull request.
